# Dataprocessing
This repository will eventually contain all needed files for the final assignment of the data processing course
from the Bio-informatics bachelor program of the [Hanze University of Applied Sciences](https://www.hanze.nl/).   
This repo should include a coherent README.md, a complete environment.yml that allows others to easily reproduce the used conda environment,
and all other files needed to run a Snakemake pipeline.
